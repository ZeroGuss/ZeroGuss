## ðŸ”´ About Me:
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a **Red Teaming expert** focused on **penetration testing**, **vulnerability assessments**, and simulating real-world cyberattacks to uncover vulnerabilities before adversaries can exploit them.

I specialize in **offensive security**, **web application security**, **network exploitation**, and **social engineering**. My goal is to continuously improve my skills and contribute to the cybersecurity community with tools, techniques, and open-source projects.

## ðŸ”´ Red Teaming Tools & Skills:
These are the tools I use to perform thorough Red Team engagements and discover vulnerabilities in systems:

- **Metasploit** â€“ A powerful exploitation framework.
- **Burp Suite** â€“ Web vulnerability scanner and interception proxy.
- **Cobalt Strike** â€“ For post-exploitation and lateral movement.
- **Kali Linux** â€“ The go-to penetration testing distro.
- **Nmap** â€“ Network scanning and discovery tool.
- **Wireshark** â€“ Packet analysis and sniffing tool.
- **Social Engineering Toolkit** â€“ Simulating real-world phishing attacks.

**Languages & Scripts:**
- **Python** â€“ Automating Red Teaming tasks.
- **PowerShell** â€“ Scripting for Windows exploitation.
- **Bash** â€“ Automating tasks in Linux environments.

## ðŸ”´ Key Red Team Techniques:
1. **Reconnaissance** â€“ Gathering intelligence about the target (OSINT).
2. **Exploitation** â€“ Finding and exploiting vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
3. **Post-Exploitation** â€“ Gaining deeper access to systems and networks.
4. **Lateral Movement** â€“ Moving through the network to escalate privileges.
5. **Persistence** â€“ Ensuring continued access to a compromised network.
6. **Exfiltration** â€“ Stealing valuable data from the target network.

## ðŸ”´ Red Teaming Methodology:
### The **Red Teaming** process involves a series of structured steps to simulate real-world adversary behavior:

1. **Initial Footprinting**: 
   - Tools: Nmap, Recon-ng, and Shodan.
2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: 
   - Tools: Nessus, OpenVAS.
3. **Exploitation and Payload Delivery**:
   - Tools: Metasploit, Cobalt Strike, MSFvenom.
4. **Post-Exploitation**: 
   - Techniques: Pivoting, privilege escalation.
5. **Reporting**:
   - Detailed Red Team reports and findings.
