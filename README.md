## 🔴 About Me:
Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a **Red Teaming** enthusiast focused on **penetration testing**, **vulnerability assessments**, and simulating real-world cyberattacks to stay ahead of threats.

Specializing in **offensive security**, **web app security**, **network exploitation**, and **social engineering**, I'm honing my skills through hands-on experience and working toward industry certifications.

My goal: to continuously grow, contribute to the cybersecurity community, and become a **Red Teaming** expert.


### Certifications (Planned for 2025):

## 🔴 Red Teaming Tools & Skills:
These are the tools I use to perform thorough Red Team engagements and discover vulnerabilities in systems:

- **Metasploit** – A powerful exploitation framework.
- **Burp Suite** – Web vulnerability scanner and interception proxy.
- **Cobalt Strike** – For post-exploitation and lateral movement.
- **Kali Linux** – The go-to penetration testing distro.
- **Nmap** – Network scanning and discovery tool.
- **Wireshark** – Packet analysis and sniffing tool.
- **Social Engineering Toolkit** – Simulating real-world phishing attacks.

**Languages & Scripts:**
- **Python** – Automating Red Teaming tasks.
- **PowerShell** – Scripting for Windows exploitation.
- **Bash** – Automating tasks in Linux environments.

## 🔴 Key Red Team Techniques:
1. **Reconnaissance** – Gathering intelligence about the target (OSINT).
2. **Exploitation** – Finding and exploiting vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
3. **Post-Exploitation** – Gaining deeper access to systems and networks.
4. **Lateral Movement** – Moving through the network to escalate privileges.
5. **Persistence** – Ensuring continued access to a compromised network.
6. **Exfiltration** – Stealing valuable data from the target network.

## 🔴 Red Teaming Methodology:
### The **Red Teaming** process involves a series of structured steps to simulate real-world adversary behavior:

1. **Initial Footprinting**: 
   - Tools: Nmap, Recon-ng, and Shodan.
2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: 
   - Tools: Nessus, OpenVAS.
3. **Exploitation and Payload Delivery**:
   - Tools: Metasploit, Cobalt Strike, MSFvenom.
4. **Post-Exploitation**: 
   - Techniques: Pivoting, privilege escalation.
5. **Reporting**:
   - Detailed Red Team reports and findings.
